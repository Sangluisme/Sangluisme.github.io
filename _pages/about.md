I am a PhD student at the Computer Vision Group at TU Munich under the guidance of [Prof. Cremers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cXQciMEAAAAJ&hl=en).
I mainly work on 3D & 4D reconstruction.

I am passionate about applying elegant mathematical theories to address practical, real-world challenges during [my research](https://sangluisme.github.io/publications/).

This is an overview over projects I was personally involved in. Check out more awesome work from our [CVG group](https://cvg.cit.tum.de/publications).
