I am a PhD student at the [Computer Vision Group](https://cvg.cit.tum.de/publications) at [TU Munich](https://tum.de) under the guidance of [Prof. Cremers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cXQciMEAAAAJ&hl=en).
Before that, I received Master degree in Mathematics from [TU Munich](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/math/home/) and Bachelor degree in applied mathematics from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/).

I am passionate about applying elegant mathematical theories to address practical, real-world challenges during [my research](https://sangluisme.github.io/publications/). My research interests include 3D geometry representation, photometric stereo and BRDF modeling, 3D & 4D reconstruction.
